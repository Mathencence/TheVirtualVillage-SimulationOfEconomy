A villager has two objectives, to gather resources and survive.
During the process, they contribute resources to the society, and when they trading resources, they create economy.

Mechanism
Each turn a villager would move and gather typically. A villager may have different efficiency agianst different resources,
so they should try to look for the type of resources that is optimal for them. A villager should wander around the places he used to get
resources before and explore if the place is consider not available at the moment.

In term of sticking around the familiar place, the villager should has a memory that contain the position. 
Thus, the movement behavoiur diverse into two variant:
1. When the memorized place(home position) is consider available the movement should has limited randomness and remain close to the home position.
2. When the home position is consider invailable, it enters a no home mode, fully explore the map with no restriction, untill it finds a suitable home position.
