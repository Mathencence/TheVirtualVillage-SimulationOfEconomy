// Villager
//Movement
A villager will search around its home position if existed one. If not he would randomly explore the map to find one.
The basic idea to determine the home position is by the rating of item he found in the specific position.
If the rating higher than home position, he immigrates, otherwise reduce the home rating accordingly to allow potential immigration.
For higher rating, the range of searching around home would be shorter, vice vera.

//Gather
When a villager discovers an item and is prepared to gather it, the item is transferred to the villager's assets. Each village has different talent levels for different items,
represented by a value ranging from -1.0 to 1.0. This talent value influences the gathering process in the following way:

- For a talent value of 0.0, the villager is guaranteed to obtain one item successfully.

- A negative talent value, represented as "-x", indicates that the villager has a probability of x to fail in obtaining the item.

- A positive talent value, represented as "x", means the villager has a probability of x to acquire an additional item.

In summary, the talent value determines the likelihood of success or failure in gathering the item, with negative values
increasing the chance of failure and positive values increasing the chance of obtaining extra items.
